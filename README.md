# 📝 Diary

This is a simple diary project that saves and displays notes saved by the user. The user interface was created using ctkinter and the data is stored in a json file with fernet encryption.

On the first run, it creates a new user (user.json file) to get to know the owner of the diary and the preferred language (English and Portuguese are allowed). After this “login”, you will receive a file with the encryption key and can write entries that will be saved in another json file (data.json).
